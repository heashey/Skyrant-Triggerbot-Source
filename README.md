everything is pasted, not 1 line of original code lol
skyrant uses a public source by Baseult: https://github.com/Baseult/Coloraimbot-CSharp
meaning they use a public "bypass" if you could even call it that.
they are full on scamming everyone with their prices and this product being literally a github paste with just a different gui.

some of this source is still obfuscated, so it wont build without errors,
hence I have added a release with skyrant build incase u just want to use it (removed auth).

Note: Their Skyrant v2 uses all the same stuff for mouse clicks, detection etc. the only thing changed is gui and weapon profiles LOL
